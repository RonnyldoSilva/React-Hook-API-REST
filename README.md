### How to Load Data from a REST API with React Hooks

With React Hooks there is another way to get data into your app. Finally we can have stateful logic in functional components – which allows us to have functional components as “containers”. If we now want a component to load data at mount, we don’t need a class component anymore. At least not just because we need state or lifecycle. Two Hooks make that possible: useState allows us to add state functionality to our component. and useEffect gives us the possibility to perform so called side effects like fetching data asynchronously.

### Install and Run
In the root:
```
sudo yarn install
yarn start
```
